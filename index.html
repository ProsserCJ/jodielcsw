            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>Life gets hard. I hope to offer you a patient, comfortable place where you can find support and restoration, as you work to process through whatever life is throwing at you. I firmly believe that the key to emotional health starts with learning to love yourself. And if you’re seeking therapy, you’re already a step closer to that goal. I use a strengths-based approach that focuses around bringing awareness to your feelings and their sources, and an understanding of the way that these feelings connect to your behaviors. From there, we can work together to help you cultivate a sense of control over your life.</p>
            <p>Sessions are 45 minutes. Private pay rate is $130 per session. Some insurances are accepted.</p>
